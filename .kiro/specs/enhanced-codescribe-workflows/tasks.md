# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Refactor existing codebase into modular architecture





  - Extract current functionality into separate modules following the new architecture
  - Create base classes and interfaces for the plugin system
  - Implement configuration management system with default settings
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement enhanced context analyzer





- [x] 2.1 Create advanced git context gathering


  - Extend current git analysis to include branch history, merge base analysis, and conflict detection
  - Add commit message analysis and conventional commit validation
  - Implement branch naming convention validation.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2.2 Build comprehensive code analysis engine


  - Implement AST parsing for JavaScript/TypeScript to analyze code structure and complexity
  - Add dependency analysis to detect new, updated, or removed dependencies
  - Create security vulnerability scanning using known vulnerability databases
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 5.1, 5.3_

- [x] 2.3 Implement project structure analysis


  - Analyze project configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
  - Detect project type and framework to customize workflow suggestions
  - Implement test coverage analysis and reporting
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 2.1_



- [x] 3.  Implement the ability to commit well on your own branch of course through a script or command here for the user using this tool to make workflows easier, cleaner and more well done. This all needs to be effectively tracked obviously in Github and in Linear properly for pushes and changes to the repository (on any branch)



- [x] 3.1 Can you also remove anything related to grep as it errored out please ('grep' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.)




- [-] 4. Enhance CodeScribe workflows with comprehensive tracking and detailed reporting


- [x] 4.1 Implement enhanced commit message generation with detailed context




  - Create AI-powered commit message generation that includes design decisions and rationale
  - Add code change impact analysis to commit messages (performance, security, maintainability)
  - Implement commit message templates for different change types (feature, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
  - Generate commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes, not just the "what"
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 5. Create Mermaid diagrams or visualizations for logic in Linear posts for commits, pull requests, etc (so on both the github and linear)





  - Build flowchart generation from function and class analysis
  - Implement code change impact visualization with dependency graphs
  - Implement sequence diagram creation for API interactions
  - Add architecture diagram generation from project structure analysis
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 6.1_

- [x] 6. Enhance Linear integration workflows




- [x] 6.1 Implement advanced ticket management


  - Add automatic ticket status transitions based on development progress
  - Implement time tracking integration with development activities
  - Create ticket scope change detection and notification system
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 6.2 Build sub-ticket creation system


  - Automatically create sub-tickets when complex changes are detected
  - Add task breakdown suggestions based on code analysis
  - Implement blocker detection and automatic sub-ticket creation
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Create more Warp Workflows based on all these different setups and kinds of usecases for codescribe. Centered around making great Warp Workflows that will be used in development workflows.





    - Implement them like and in the stuff in C:\Users\MohammedElshrief\Downloads\CodeScribe\.warp
    - Create comprehensive documentation on how to do it, work it, descrptions, workflows, etc


- [x] 8.1 Build enhanced command structure centered around Warp




  - Implement subcommands for different workflow types
  - Add interactive mode for guided workflow execution
  - Create help system with context-aware suggestions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 8.2 Implement progress reporting and logging


  - Add detailed progress reporting for long-running workflows
  - Create comprehensive logging system with different verbosity levels
  - Implement workflow execution history and replay functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [-] 9. Create documentation and examples



- [-] 9.1 Write comprehensive user documentation

  - Create getting started guide with common workflow examples
  - Add configuration reference documentation
  - Implement plugin development guide with examples
  - Explain a primary working flow of how to do automate this common primary flow: 1. Developer makes chanes after working for some time 2. now he obviously needs to make a seperate branch (the commit and push stuff we've been doing and needing to do for a seperate remote branch matching the ticket id on linear), and then doing the pull request with all relavent github information and all relavent linear messages, documentation, communication etc.
  - _Requirements: All requirements_

- [ ] 9.2 Build example configurations and workflows
  - Create example configurations for different project types
  - Add sample custom workflows for common use cases
  - Implement demo repository with full workflow examples
  - _Requirements: All requirements_
