# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing CodeScribe agent to become a comprehensive workflow orchestration tool for professional software engineers. The enhanced system will expand beyond basic PR creation and Linear updates to include advanced GitHub workflows, intelligent code analysis, visual documentation generation, enhanced Linear integration, and automated development lifecycle management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want CodeScribe to intelligently analyze my code changes and suggest appropriate commit messages, PR templates, and workflow actions, so that I can maintain consistent and professional development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs CodeScribe THEN the system SHALL analyze git diff content and suggest conventional commit messages
2. WHEN code changes include breaking changes THEN the system SHALL automatically flag them and suggest appropriate versioning
3. WHEN code changes include new dependencies THEN the system SHALL analyze security implications and suggest review requirements
4. IF code changes affect multiple modules THEN the system SHALL suggest splitting into multiple PRs
5. I want the ability/command to possibly undo/cancel Pull Requests if I don't like them upon further review. (revert back), (and change Linear Status Accordingly)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want CodeScribe to automate common GitHub workflows like issue creation, branch management, and release preparation, so that I can focus on coding rather than administrative tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CodeScribe detects bug patterns in code THEN the system SHALL automatically create GitHub issues with detailed descriptions
2. WHEN a feature branch is complete THEN the system SHALL offer to create release notes and version tags
3. WHEN merge conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent resolution suggestions
4. IF a PR has been approved THEN the system SHALL offer to automatically merge and clean up branches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want CodeScribe to generate visual documentation like flowcharts and architecture diagrams from my code, so that I can maintain up-to-date project documentation automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CodeScribe analyzes code changes THEN the system SHALL generate Mermaid diagrams for new functions or classes
2. WHEN system architecture changes are detected THEN the system SHALL update existing architecture diagrams
3. WHEN API endpoints are modified THEN the system SHALL generate updated API flow diagrams
4. IF database schema changes are detected THEN the system SHALL create entity relationship diagrams

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want enhanced Linear integration that can manage ticket workflows, time tracking, and project planning, so that I can keep stakeholders informed without manual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN work begins on a ticket THEN the system SHALL automatically transition ticket status and start time tracking
2. WHEN code review feedback is received THEN the system SHALL update Linear with review status and estimated completion time
3. WHEN blockers are detected in code THEN the system SHALL create sub-tickets and notify relevant team members
4. IF a ticket scope changes significantly THEN the system SHALL suggest ticket splitting and stakeholder notification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want CodeScribe to help with code quality and technical debt management, so that I can maintain high code standards and address issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CodeScribe analyzes code THEN the system SHALL identify potential technical debt and suggest refactoring opportunities
2. WHEN code complexity exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL suggest breaking down functions or classes
